# Changelog

The change log describes what been "Added", "Removed", "Changed" or "Fixed" between versions

### Unreleased

- The `setHttpClient`, `setServerToken` and `getServerToken` methods have been removed from `Stampie\MailerInterface`.
- The `Stampie\MailerInterface::send` method no longer return a boolean. Errors are now reported using exceptions that implements `Stampie\ExceptionInterface`. As core mailers were already throwing exceptions when sending a message, the BC break impact is limited.
- The `SendGrid` mailer is updated to version 3. Please update your token.
- `SendGrid::setServerToken()` was removed. Use constructor instead.
